# wordpress appplication template
App Templates are packaged app samples designed to reduce the time it takes a developer to deploy their code to Azure. Unlike standalone example code, the goal of App Templates is to provide all the components to deploy an app to Azure with automation via GitHub Actions or other CI/CD services. 

This specific sample consists of example code, CI/CD components, and documentation containing all the required steps to deploy **a fully functional worspress site** and is designed to be compatible with the [Azure Developer CLI(azd)](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/) which is currently in preview.

The purpose of App Templates is to deliver and prove the value of accelerated onboarding for developers who are new to Azure.
## Overview 

WordPress (WP or WordPress.org) is a free and open-source content management system (CMS) written in PHP and paired with a MySQL or MariaDB database. Features include a plugin architecture and a template system, referred to within WordPress as "Themes". WordPress was originally created as a blog-publishing system but has evolved to support other web content types including more traditional mailing lists and Internet fora, media galleries, membership sites, learning management systems (LMS) and online stores. One of the most popular content management system solutions in use, WordPress is used by 42.8% of the top 10 million websites as of October 2021.

To function, WordPress at minimum has to be installed on a web server and connect to a mySQL database. So, to deploy Wordpress in Azure a number of different options can be leveraged.
